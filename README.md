# CT Portfolio Simulator

A fictional, browser-based portfolio simulator inspired by Crypto Twitter behavior.

This project explores how narratives, confidence, and position sizing interact over time — without real money, wallets, or charts.

Built to reflect how decisions compound, not how trades look in hindsight.

### Why this exists
Most people don’t blow up because they’re wrong once.  
They blow up because they’re overconfident repeatedly.

This simulator is a mirror for that behavior.

### How it was built
This project was **vibe-coded using Claude AI**.
Instead of traditional development, the focus was on:
- intent
- constraints
- decision pressure
- user experience

AI handled the implementation.  
Human taste handled the design.

### Tech
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Frontend-only
- No backend, no APIs
- Hosted via GitHub Pages
